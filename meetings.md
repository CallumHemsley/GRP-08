  This week, our supervisor is in UK so meeting over WeChat voice call.

  Introduction on our current state:
* We went to Tianyi Pavillion to take photos of buildings.
* There was a problem with the 3D software "reality capture":
    * To buy is very expensive, around 40,000 RMB.
    * We are trying the free version currently.
    * We are also unsure on how long this license for 40,000 RMB lasts e.g 3 months, the whole year etc.


  We are currently making the requirements specification now.



  Following that this week we will create some UML.


  Due to software being so expensive, we are thinking about pursuing different options in order to make the application immersive.
  One such example is using 2D design instead, which allows for us to create more interactions for the user.


  Website deadline is for the 31st October. (We have already set this up)


  marking of the website is on 1st November.
