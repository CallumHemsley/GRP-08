##	Background Information:
  Nowadays, cultural relics are in an urgent need of protection due to various reasons. Some technology available are new ways to protect and memorize the cultural heritage.
  Last year, Tecent Technology together DunHuang Academy China launched a project called Digital DunHuang which uses various technical capabilities such as VR and AR to make visitors have an immersive experience of DunHuang and to have a deeper understanding of the history, art and technology value behind the DunHuang, hopefully to make DunHuang relics have an immortal life in modern days.
We could see that digital high technologies are being growing used in the field of cultural heritage protection and promotion.

 
##	Project Vision 
  All of our members have the vision, passion and the faith that we could do some contribution to the protection of cultural heritage by doing this project.
  Generally, we would like to build this app as a game in which the gamer/visitor could control a character that would move in the scene just like the RPG games, various ways are used such as image, audio and video to restore the real TianYi Pavilion in the app, hopefully to combine with VR & AR techniques to enhance the immersive tour experience of the visitor. 
Firstly, we would go to TianYi Pavilion to take photos of the relics and samples, gather the corresponding information of the relics including but not limited to images, audios and videos, moreover to gather the requirements of stakeholders (TianYi Pavilion/Visitors) and then build a prototype.
  At the same time, UI design will start.
  Secondly, the photos taken will be used to modelling the whole TianYi Pavilion scene hopefully to make it VR-lized. 
  Thirdly, some modelling software available such as blender, 3DS Max will be used to model the relics. The models will also be textured. 
After that, Unity3D will be used to develop the app including putting the scene and the models into the app, making characters, C# scripts coding and other relevant procedures.
  Once the demo is done, we will continuously debug and update the app to meet the continuous-updated requirements and maintain the system. 
We have the vision that by developing this TianYi Pavilion tour guide app, we could not only make visitors have an immersive experience of visiting cultural heritage, but also restore the TianYi Pavilion in an digital way and make a little contribution to Ningbo as well as the field of cultural heritage moreover to arouse the public’s awareness of heritage conservation. 
We hope to be the warden and ‘digital caregivers’ of our history and culture.
